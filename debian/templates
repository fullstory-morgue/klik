Template: fll/klik/fstabenable
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Setup user mounting of klik images?
 Klik defaults to using a compressed image file to store each application
 you get in one file. To allow users to run applications in this way, the
 root user must setup /etc/fstab and create a directory (normally
 /mnt/app).
 .
 If you wish to perform these steps you can run klik-root-setup as root at
 any time.

Template: fll/klik/klikgroup
Type: string
_Default: klik
_Description: Group for klik users:
 You can limit access to mounting klik's compressed images to any system
 group.  The default of option of klik will create a new group called klik,
 providing one does not already exist.   Choosing klik will also allow you
 to add users you wish to that group now.
 .
 If you enter "none", then only root will have access to use klik.  If you
 enter "all", any user will be able to use kliks compressed images.  If you
 enter your own, non-root, username then only you will be able to use the
 mount points.
 .
 It is worth noting that klik can simply be used by any user irrespectively
 by using directories rather then compressed images to store applications.

Template: fll/klik/klikusers
Type: string
_Description: Users (comma seperated) to place in klik group:
 You can choose to place as many users as you wish in the klik group. 
 Enter them as a comma seperated list.
 .
 This group simply controls who can access (write) to /mnt/app, and hence
 control mounting of kliks compressed image files to run their own
 applications.
