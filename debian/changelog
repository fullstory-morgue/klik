klik (0.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * May be usable ... with a correct setup
  * Resync back to standard klik client
  * Fuse only mounting
  * ssft dependency (instead of *dialog)
  * klik-setup-* moved to /usr/share/doc/klik/setup
  * programs now klik and zAppRun in /usr/bin/
  * packaging simplified dropping all the root setup
